# Setup

There are two parts to the setup. First, you must create a bot user to add to your Discord. Then, you run the application in your preferred environment using the bot's token.

## Discord Bot User Setup

1) Get your [Discord bot token](https://www.writebots.com/discord-bot-token/) from the Discord [Application Developer site](https://discord.com/developers/applications).
2) Download the project folder.
3) Create a file called ".env" (no name, just the extension) in this folder, with the file's content being a single line of text: `DISCORD_TOKEN={YourTokenGoesHere}`. Replace "{YourTokenGoesHere}," including the brackets, with the token you generated.
    - Optionally, add another line: `BOT_ADMIN_ID={YourDiscordUserId}`. Replace "{YourDiscordUserId}," with the [ID of your Discord user](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/206346498-Where-can-I-find-my-User-Server-Message-ID). This will allow your user to have access to the Debug logging commands.
4) Using the same website you retrieved the bot token from, create an invite link to invite your bot to your Discord server.
5) The bot will be added to your server but not yet functional. Proceed with either the Windows or Docker installation steps below depending on how you are hosting the bot.

## Windows Instructions
1) Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/).
2) Run "runbot.bat" and enjoy!

## Linux (Docker) Instructions
1) Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).
2) Copy the required contents of the project folder into a folder on your server (ex. /HarmoniBot).
    - libs folder
    - Dockerfile
    - index.js
    - package.json
    - .env file
3) Change your running directory to this newly created folder and run the following command to create the Docker image: `docker build -t harmonibot .`
4) Once complete, run this command to create and run the Docker container: `docker run -d --name harmonibot-container harmonibot`
